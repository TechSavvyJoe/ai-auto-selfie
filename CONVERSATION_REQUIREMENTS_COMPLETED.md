## 📋 USER REQUESTS & COMPLETION STATUS

### Request 1: "Improve AUTO AI caption generator - make it not boring"
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

**What was wrong:**
- Caption generator was using a basic prompt
- Generated generic captions like "Sharing the moment"
- No context-awareness or personality

**What was fixed** (geminiService.ts):
- Enhanced prompt with detailed tone-specific guidance
- Added tone-specific examples for AI to follow
- Instructions to make captions ENGAGING:
  - Hook the reader
  - Spark emotion
  - Provoke thought
  - Be specific to image content
- Now generates captions that match the theme and feel

**Example Results:**
- **Before**: "Sharing the moment"
- **After**: "Living for these golden hour moments ✨ Nothing beats this vibe" (friendly)
- **After**: "Excellence isn't an act, it's a habit. Elevating every frame." (professional)

### Request 2: "Fix download button - stop making users paste to Photos app"
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

**What was wrong:**
- iOS download was using clipboard as primary method
- Users had to manually copy and paste into Photos app
- Message said: "Photo copied! Open Photos app and paste..."

**What was fixed** (smartDownloadService.ts):
- Changed iOS to use **Share API first** (primary method)
- Share API opens native iOS share sheet with "Save to Photos" option

- Clipboard only used as final fallback if Share API unavailable
