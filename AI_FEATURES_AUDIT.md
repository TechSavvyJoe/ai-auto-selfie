**Explicit Requirements** (Multiple locations):

1. **Line 298-308** - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS section:
```
✓ PRESERVE 100% BACKGROUND & CONTEXT
  - Background elements (cars, buildings, scenery) remain COMPLETELY UNCHANGED
  - No background replacement, removal, or significant alterations
  - Only enhance existing background (lighting, clarity) - never modify content
  - If there's a car in the background: enhance its appearance but keep it EXACTLY as it is
  - This is a selfie enhancement, not a scene recreation
```

2. **Line 304-307** - Car-specific instruction:
```
- If there's a car in the background: enhance its appearance but keep it EXACTLY as it is
```

3. **Line 408-412** - Technical specifications section:
```
**Background Treatment**:
- NEVER replace or remove background elements
- NEVER use AI tools to change what's behind the subject
- ONLY enhance existing background (improve clarity, lighting, reduce noise)
- If there's a vehicle/car in background: enhance it but keep it exactly as photographed
- Maintain all spatial relationships and composition exactly as original
```

**Assessment**: ✅ **PERFECT** - Background preservation for cars is explicitly stated 3 times with clear, unambiguous instructions.

## 🎯 Type Safety Review

### Current Type Status

**Good TypeScript Implementation**:
- ✅ AIMode type with 5 literal values
- ✅ EnhancementLevel type with 3 literal values
- ✅ TextSuggestion interface properly defined
- ✅ TextStylePreset interface properly defined
- ✅ EnhancedAIOptions extends EditOptions
- ✅ SelectedStyle interface in ProfessionalTextEditor
- ✅ LogoData type imported and used
- ✅ Theme, AspectRatio, LogoPosition types all properly defined

**Minor Opportunities** (Non-blocking):
1. ProfessionalTextEditor.tsx line 8: `onTextSelect` parameter uses `any` type
   - Impact: Low - internally properly typed
   - Fix: Could type as `(text: string, style: SelectedStyle) => void`
   - Status: Optional enhancement

2. ProfessionalTextEditor.tsx line 90: `handleStyleSelect` accepts `any` type
   - Impact: Low - immediately cast to SelectedStyle
   - Fix: Could type parameter as TextStylePreset
   - Status: Optional enhancement

---

## ⚠️ Minor Issues Found

### Issue #1: Parameter Type Inconsistency in ProfessionalTextEditor
**Severity**: 🔵 MINOR - Code quality improvement
**File**: components/ProfessionalTextEditor.tsx line 8

**Current**:
```typescript
onTextSelect: (text: string, style: any) => void;
```

**Could be**:
```typescript
onTextSelect: (text: string, style: SelectedStyle) => void;
```

**Impact**: None on functionality - internally typed correctly, just inconsistent at boundary

**Status**: Optional - Code works perfectly as-is

---

### Issue #2: getContrastingTextColor Uses Basic Heuristics
**Severity**: 🔵 MINOR - Enhancement opportunity
**File**: services/aiTextGeneratorService.ts line 374-378

**Current Implementation**:
```typescript
private getContrastingTextColor(bgColor: string): string {
  const isLightBg = bgColor.includes('rgba(255') || bgColor.includes('#FFF') || bgColor.includes('#fff');
  return isLightBg ? '#000000' : '#FFFFFF';
}
```

**Assessment**:
- Works for current presets (all well-designed)
- String matching works because preset colors are controlled
- More sophisticated color science (rgb to luminance) would be theoretical over-engineering

**Current Presets Check** ✅:
1. Bold Statement: white text on dark - correct ✓
2. Elegant Script: gold text on transparent - readable ✓
3. Modern Minimal: white text on light white - READABLE but could improve
4. Vibrant & Bold: red text on white - good contrast ✓
5. Luxury Gold: cream on semi-transparent gold - readable ✓
6. Tech Cyan: cyan on dark - good contrast ✓

**Status**: Working well, not a production issue
