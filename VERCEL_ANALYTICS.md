# Vercel Analytics Integration

> Real-time performance monitoring for your production app

---

## ✅ What's Been Added

The Vercel Analytics component has been integrated into your app:

**File:** `App.tsx`

```tsx
// Import
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';

// Usage (inside AppContent component)
<Analytics />
```

The component is positioned at the bottom of your main app div, which automatically tracks:
- ✅ Core Web Vitals (LCP, FCP, CLS, INP)
- ✅ Page performance metrics
- ✅ User interactions
- ✅ Device and browser information
- ✅ Real user monitoring (RUM)

---

## What Gets Tracked

### Core Web Vitals
| Metric | What It Measures | Target |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **LCP** | Largest Contentful Paint - when main content loads | < 4.0s |
| **FCP** | First Contentful Paint - when first pixel appears | < 1.8s |
| **CLS** | Cumulative Layout Shift - visual stability | < 0.1 |
| **INP** | Interaction to Next Paint - responsiveness | < 200ms |

### Additional Metrics
- Page load time
- Time to first byte (TTFB)
- Network information
- Device type (mobile/desktop)
- Browser type and version
- Connection type (4G/5G/etc)

### User Interactions Tracked
- Button clicks
- Form submissions
- Navigation events
- Page visibility changes
- Custom events (if configured)

---

## Where to View Analytics

### Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Select your project: `ai-auto-selfie`
3. Click **Analytics** tab
4. See real-time metrics and historical data

### What You'll See
- **Real-time dashboard** - Current visitors and performance
- **Web Vitals** - Core Web Vitals over time
- **Traffic patterns** - When users visit
- **Device/browser breakdown** - Who's visiting
- **Performance trends** - Improvements/regressions

---

## Configuration Options

The Analytics component works automatically with no configuration needed. However, you can customize it:

### Basic Usage (Current)
```tsx
<Analytics />
```

### Advanced Usage
```tsx
// Track custom events
import { track } from '@vercel/analytics';

// Track event
track('user_enhanced_image', {
  theme: 'modern',
  filters: 3,
  duration_ms: 2500
});

// Track conversion
track('image_downloaded', {
  format: 'jpeg',
  quality: 90
});
```

## Performance Monitoring Benefits

### For Developers
- 📊 Real data on how your app performs
- 🔍 Identify slow pages or features
- 📈 Track performance improvements
- 🐛 Detect regressions early
- 🌍 See global performance distribution

### For Users
- ⚡ Faster app = better experience
- 📱 Mobile optimization visibility
- 🔧 Data-driven improvements
- 🌐 Global CDN optimization

---

## How It Works

```
Your App (App.tsx)
    ↓
<Analytics /> component
    ↓
Collects metrics in background
    ↓
Sends to Vercel (batched, non-blocking)
    ↓
Displayed in Vercel Dashboard
```

**Zero impact on performance** - Analytics runs in a separate thread and doesn't block your app.

---

## Custom Event Tracking

You can add custom tracking in your components:

### Example 1: Track Image Enhancement
```tsx
import { track } from '@vercel/analytics';

const handleEnhance = async () => {
  const startTime = performance.now();

  await enhanceImage();

  const duration = performance.now() - startTime;

  track('image_enhanced', {
    theme: editOptions.theme,
    filters_applied: filterCount,
    duration_ms: Math.round(duration),
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
};
```

### Example 2: Track Feature Usage
```tsx
// In ThemeSwitcher.tsx
track('theme_switched', {
  from_theme: previousTheme,
  to_theme: newTheme,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});

// In EditView.tsx
track('filter_applied', {
  filter_name: filterName,
  order_number: filterIndex
});

// In components when user takes action
track('preset_created', {
  preset_name: name,
  adjustments_count: Object.keys(adjustments).length
});
```

## Privacy & Data

### What's NOT Tracked
- ❌ User IP addresses (anonymized)
- ❌ Personal information
- ❌ Image content
- ❌ Sensitive user data
- ❌ Cookies or persistent identifiers

### What IS Tracked

## Common Improvements to Track

### After Image Optimization
- Monitor: LCP and FCP should decrease
- Expected improvement: 10-20% faster
- Check: Large images loading faster

### After Code Splitting
- Monitor: First Page Load and TTI
- Expected improvement: 15-30% faster initial load
- Check: Feature pages load faster

### After Caching Implementation
- Monitor: TTFB and repeat visit speed
- Expected improvement: 50%+ faster for repeat users
- Check: Return visitors much faster
